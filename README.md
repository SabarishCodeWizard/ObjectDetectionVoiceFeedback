# ObjectDetectionVoiceFeedback
"Real-time object detection with YOLO and Text-to-Speech integration for webcam feed in Python."

Structure the project directory:
project_directory/
|-- your_script.py
|-- yolov3.weights
|-- yolov3.cfg
|-- coco.names



YOLO GitHub Repository:
YOLO is open-source, and you can find the official repository on GitHub. The repository URL is: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet

Download YOLOv3 Weights (Pre-trained):
YOLOv3 weights file is relatively large, and it's commonly available for download separately from the configuration file. You can find the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights at the following link: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

Download YOLOv3 Configuration File (cfg):
The configuration file (.cfg) contains the architecture and settings of the YOLOv3 model. You can find the YOLOv3.cfg file in the official repository under the cfg directory: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/tree/master/cfg

Download COCO Names File (Optional):
The COCO names file contains the names of the classes that the YOLO model can detect. You can find it in the official repository under the data directory: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names


Now that you have the necessary files (yolov3.weights, yolov3.cfg, and coco.names), you can use them in your Python script for object detection. Make sure to update the file paths in your script to point to the correct locations of these files on your system.


Install Required Python Libraries:
Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can use the following command to install them using pip : pip install opencv-python numpy gtts
